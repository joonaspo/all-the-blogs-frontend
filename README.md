## About this project

This repository contains the front end for my blogging application project. I have tried to follow the best practices in using the selected technologies. All operations related to the application state in Redux are handled using action creators to make the React components as light as possible in terms of application logic.

All token-requiring user operations are authenticated using Json Web Token.

I have also added ESLint to the project to maintain constant code quality across the project.
